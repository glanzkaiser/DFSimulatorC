proj() â€“ It returns the projection of z(complex number) onto the Riemann sphere. The projection of z is z, except for complex infinities, which are mapped to the complex value with a real component of INFINITY and an imaginary component of 0.0 or -0.0 (where supported), depending on the sign of the imaginary component of z. 

// Illustrating the use of proj()

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// For std::complex, std::proj
#include <complex>

// driver program
int main()
{
	std::complex<double> c1(1, 2);
	cout << "proj" << c1 << " = " << proj(c1) << endl;

	std::complex<double> c2(INFINITY, -1);
	cout << "proj" << c2 << " = " << proj(c2) << endl;

	std::complex<double> c3(0, -INFINITY);
	cout << "proj" << c3 << " = " << proj(c3) << endl;
}
