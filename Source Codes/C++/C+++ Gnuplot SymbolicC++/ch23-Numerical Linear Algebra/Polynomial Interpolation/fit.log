FIT:    data read from '-'
        format = z
        x range restricted to [-1.00000 : 5.00000]
        #datapoints = 4
        residuals are weighted equally (unit weight)

function used for fitting: f(x)
	f(x) = a + b*x + c*x*x + d*x*x*x
fitted parameters initialized with current variable values

After 8 iterations the fit converged.
final sum of squares of residuals : 1.43967e-29
rel. change during last iteration : 0


Exactly as many data points as there are parameters.
In this degenerate case, all errors are zero by definition.

Final set of parameters 
======================= 

a               = 4              
b               = 9.5            
c               = -14            
d               = 3.5
